**notes:**
for now, let's just think about the optimal way to do things

*current TODOs:*

+ code in system (collision?) so that you cannot walk past the walls
+ start creating the battle system
  - *use a system where you get one turn per party member, and enemies get one turn per enemy, for Press Turn-style*
